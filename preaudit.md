Security Audit Checklist
Reentrancy Guard

✔️ The ReentrancyGuard modifier is implemented to prevent reentrancy attacks, especially in the swapAndLiquify and transfer functions.
Pausable Contract

✔️ The contract is pausable, allowing the owner to halt transfers in case of emergencies.
Ownership Management

✔️ Ownership transfer mechanism is implemented with a pending owner confirmation to prevent accidental or malicious transfers of contract ownership.
Audit Recommendation: Consider adding a multi-signature wallet for more secure ownership management, especially for critical functions.
Anti-Bot Measures

✔️ Cooldown between transactions using txCooldownTime and anti-bot measures are in place to mitigate potential abuse.
✔️ Gas price limit checks ensure that transactions don't exceed a specified gas price to prevent front-running.
Blacklisting Mechanism

✔️ A blacklist feature prevents specific addresses from interacting with the contract.
Max Transaction & Wallet Limits

✔️ Maximum transaction size (_maxTxAmount) and wallet limits (_walletMax) are implemented to control large transfers and whale activities.
Audit Recommendation: Regularly monitor and adjust these limits to prevent any unforeseen manipulation.
Liquidity Protection

✔️ Swap and liquify mechanism with lockTheSwap modifier ensures that liquidity is only added in a secure manner, preventing multiple swap attempts from occurring simultaneously.
Secure Token Approvals

✔️ The _approve function is implemented to ensure proper token approvals before any swap or liquidity operations.
Gas Optimizations

✔️ Usage of SafeMath ensures that overflow/underflow issues in token transfers and calculations are avoided.
Audit Recommendation: Review gas-heavy functions such as swapAndLiquify and optimize further if necessary.
Profitability and Fee Management Checklist
Buy and Sell Fees

✔️ Buy taxes and sell taxes are configurable with clear limits (MAX_BUY_TAX and MAX_SELL_TAX), ensuring that taxes do not exceed 10%.
Profitability:
Marketing fee for buy and sell is set at 2%, ensuring consistent revenue for marketing efforts.
Team fee for buy and sell ensures the team gets paid consistently.
Referral Program

✔️ A 1% referral reward mechanism is in place to incentivize users to refer others, creating organic growth.
Profitability: The referral program enhances token spread and engagement, benefiting overall token adoption.
Liquidity Management

✔️ Swap and liquify logic ensures part of the fees are added back to liquidity, increasing the token's liquidity pool over time.
Profitability: Liquidity addition helps improve market depth and price stability, benefiting token holders and reducing slippage in large transactions.
Airdrop Functionality

✔️ Airdrop tokens feature allows the owner to distribute tokens to multiple recipients. This can be used for promotional activities or donations.
Profitability: Strategic airdrops can be used for marketing, increasing user base and token exposure.
Vesting Schedule for Token Releases

✔️ Vesting schedules ensure that tokens can be locked and released over time for specific wallets, which is beneficial for long-term project sustainability.
Profitability: Ensures that tokens allocated to team members or partners are released over time, preventing sudden dumps that could crash the token price.
Burn Mechanism

✔️ The burn feature reduces the total supply, increasing the scarcity of tokens, which is beneficial for long-term price growth.
Profitability: Burning tokens reduces overall supply, thus increasing demand and value of remaining tokens over time.
Exclusion from Fees

✔️ Specific wallets like the owner, contract address, and Uniswap pair are exempt from fees to ensure efficient operations.
Profitability: Excluding key addresses from fees ensures that important transactions (like liquidity additions) are not unnecessarily taxed.
